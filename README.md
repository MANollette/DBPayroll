# DBPayroll
Small, simple all-encompassing payroll system for basic hourly and salary employees. 

---SUMMARY---
Iâ€™d like to construct a   complete payroll system using WPF for the application foundation,connected to a   SQL database to store employee information, income classification, tax brackets, etc. The system should be able to accept user input for CRUD operations on thedatabase, as well as generating complete paychecks based on hours worked. Every aspect of a normal payroll system should be present (PTO accrual, insurance, 401K deductions, etc). Ideally, this will also support paycheck exporting in PDF format
---END SUMMARY---
